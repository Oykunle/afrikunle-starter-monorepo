## 🌍 Vision

Afrikunle is a learning platform designed to help people **learn to code in their own language**.

We believe that coding should be accessible to everyone — not only in English.  
Afrikunle helps users learn **Python** in **English 🇬🇧**, **French 🇫🇷**, and soon **Yorùbá**, **Swahili**, and **Hausa**.

> “If you can think in your language, you can code in your language.”

## ✨ Key Features

### 🌐 Multilingual Learning
Instantly switch between English and French lessons.  
Each lesson is stored with translations, and more languages will be added soon.

### 🗣️ Voice Tutor
Afrikunle uses `expo-speech` to **speak lessons aloud** — it’s your personal AI coding tutor that can explain each Python concept in your native language.

### 💻 Real Python Code Execution
Write and run Python directly inside the app!  
Afrikunle connects to a secure Flask backend that safely executes your code in a sandboxed environment.

### 🎚 Voice Speed & Personalization
Change the tutor’s speaking speed (🐢 slow, ⚖️ normal, ⚡ fast), and personalize your experience with your name and language preference.
